# ProteinPal

I created a React app designed to inspire users to shop for protein products.
Aesthetically I wanted to aim for the modern Millenial; Sunday Morning Coffees, Autumnal Walks and nothing to drastic for the eye. 
Users can explore different protein options while discovering motivation to stay consistent with their health goals.

## Inspiration 

Most of us have no idea how much protein weâ€™re really eating. Even regular gym-goers often guess instead of tracking. Yet protein is key if you want to grow muscle, recover, and feel stronger. 
It took me years of crash dieting and working in a high calorie deficit to realize, the focus should be on high protein.
It is very difficult to find out foods with a high amount of protein. I wanted a simple resource where you can get some inspiration, slam it down onto a shopping list and head to the shops.

For my react set up, I wanted to split the pages and the other components. For ease of use in this project as it is small scale, I removed extra folders, so I could easily spot my jsx files.

The two main controllers are : (1) Items; where I pull from the api using axios.get (2) Lists, where I have CRUD functionality for the users lists.


## 3rd Party Api

I wanted to keep utilising third party api's, I belive the knowledge gained in implementing them into my websites will help me further in my career. This database is HUGE, initially I wanted to iterate through the whole database, so I could find the top 100 foods based off protein content. This wasnt achievable with my current set up.
Now I just focused on showing the functionality and that it can be done. I sorted the data with proteins_100g and put them in a descending order. I have only selected the item size as 30. Here, I can show the functionality I have implemented on a small scale, with high hopes in future to iterate over the full database!

## Future Enhancements

- There is a myriad of further enhancements I would like to make.
- I would like to find a different database. The images arent up to standard. I would like to find a database of foods with professional images attached.
- Cart to have mobile functionality for on the go, whilst in a supermarket.
- CSS: Introduce more font styles, button improvements and mobile responsiveness


## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Implement user data, track the users personalised protein goal.
- [ ] Analytics on the user page, how many times a product has been put in shopping cart, etc.
- [ ] Search function, when the database size is increased.
